## Capsule: `ruleN`

**Purpose:** Encodes constraint, safety, and regulatory logic for evaluating compliance in `drip`, `grip`, `scrip`, `quote`, and `trip` objects â€” without relying on copyrighted code text.

```yaml
uid_ref: traceN           # Symbolic UID for traceable rule audit trail
source_profile: profileN  # Identity of rule author or source
origin_ref: originN       # Source of the rule context (chat, job, inspector)
key_ref: keyN             # Optional validator or override credential
```
