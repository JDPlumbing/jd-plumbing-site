## Capsule: `costN`

**Purpose:** Encodes symbolic cost inputs, regional modifiers, pricing signals, and justification logic. Provides traceable influence over quote confidence, pricing elasticity, and escalation triggers.

```yaml
uid_ref: traceN          # Tracks the symbolic instance of the cost input
source_profile: profileN # Identity of the actor who triggered/modified cost
origin_ref: originN      # How the cost update was delivered or inferred
key_ref: keyN            # Optional cryptographic confirmation of source
```

## ðŸ’¸ Overview

`costN` represents dynamic pricing data for labor, materials, fuel, regulatory, and other job-impacting financial factors. Each cost can be scoped by region, time, source reliability, and influence zone.

Used for:
- Auto-adjusting `quoteN` values based on regional or temporal surges
- Highlighting volatile or high-impact pricing variables
- Anchoring audit trails and pricing justification
- Supporting override, suppression, or reflective triggering

## ðŸ”— Integration Notes

- `costN` capsules are consumed by `quoteN`, `salesN`, and `reflectN`
- Reflex-aware capsules may use `costN.adjustment_mode` to flag quote reliability or request manual intervention
- Combined with `boostN` or `billN` for pricing elasticity or job-specific justification logic
